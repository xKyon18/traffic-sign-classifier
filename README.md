1.  Process Data
   -  convert dataset into right dimensions
   -  compile and store(pickle) dataset
2.  Image Manipulation
  -  Flip Image (Vertical, Horizontal, Both) 
  -  Augment Image
  -  Adjust Contrast
  -  Convert to black and white (when dataset is balanced)
3.  Make Model in Pytorch
4.  Pre-train Model
5.  Save Model if satisfied with Accuracy
6.  Make C++ program for test
7.  Use ssaved model (libtorch)
8. Take Results
